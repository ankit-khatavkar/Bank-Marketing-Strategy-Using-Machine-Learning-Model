# Bank-Marketing-Strategy-Using-Machine-Learning-Model

Marketing campaigns are specified by keeping in consideration of customer needs and their overall satisfaction. There are different variables that determine the success of marketing campaigns.
The Four P’s which will help to determine the marketing campaigns are:
Segment of the Population:  Which section of the population marketing campaign is going to represent and why? and this will help to know which section of the population have higher chances of receiving the messages of marketing campaign.
Distribution channel to reach the customer's place: How to get most customers through the marketing campaign and which instrument will be helpful to get the message out  
Price: What is the best price to offer to potential clients?
Promotional Strategy: In-depth analysis of the previous campaigns which will give insights on previous patterns and mistakes through this effective way for current campaign could be find out.
A term store is a fixed-term store of cash held at a financial institution. Term stores are typically transient stores with developments extending from one month to a couple of years. At the point when a term store is acquired, the customer comprehends that the cash must be pulled back after the term has finished or now and again, by giving a foreordained number of days take note.
Our principle challenge lies in accomplishing high precision in the expectation part of our modelling procedure. Since the information is delicate and needs the most extreme precision to be kept up while foreseeing. We at first begin with understanding the idea of the information and picturing its angles and the relationship it holds among itself so as to show better and eﬃciently. We at that point hold a near investigation of the displaying methods lastly select the most appropriate model which fits the given dataset with most extreme precision.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our key objective is to analyze the data attributes provided by the dataset we have currently chosen i.e. banking.csv, We are going to use data from a marketing campaign implemented by a major banking institution. The outcome, y, is whether or not a bank salesperson was able to get a client to sign up for a term deposit (and is labeled 0 for no, and 1 for yes). The objective is to utilize classification algorithms to help the bank management and sales team understand how to maximize clients signing up for a term deposit.
